### markdown processor: mistune
### backend: fastapi
### frontend: vanilla html + css
### time took to make it: ~7hrs 

I have messed around with python, but this is the first time I actually made any sort of a project. ever.

I learnt:
- Serving static files w/ FastAPI, just that nothing else related to the framework
- the basic overview of classes
- markdown
- jinja2 templating
- deploying a fastapi application with vercel
- html and css

in actuality, this project took an additional 2 weeks because I discovered this little
thing called Neovim.

I bounced around from neovim distro to neovim distro unsatisfied. 
until I wrote my own from scratch, which was painful to say the least.
but hey, atleast the config is rock solid and nothing wrong.
no really, ever since making my own config, the experience has been buttery smooth.

here is my [config](https://github.com/pasmanitan/.config).
